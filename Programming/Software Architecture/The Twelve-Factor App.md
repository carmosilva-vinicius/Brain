The Twelve-Factor App methodology is a set of best practices for building software-as-a-service applications. It aims to reduce the complexity of deploying and managing applications, especially in cloud environments. Here's a detailed explanation of the twelve factors, along with examples where applicable:

### 1. Codebase
Each copy of the app is built from the exact same source code hosted in a version control repository. This ensures consistency across all environments and simplifies the deployment process.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/user/app.git cd app
```

### 2. Dependencies
Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies. Use a dependency declaration manifest file, such as `package.json` for Node.js or `pom.xml` for Java, to specify all required packages.
```json
{   
	"name": "my-app",
	"version": "1.0.0",   
	"dependencies": {
		"express": "^4.17.1"   
	} 
}
```
### 3. Config
Store configuration in the environment. Avoid hardcoding values in the code. Use environment variables or configuration files that are loaded at runtime.
```python
import os 
DATABASE_URL = os.getenv('DATABASE_URL', 'sqlite:///default.db')
```
### 4. Backing Services
Treat backing services (like databases) as attached resources. Your app should not be concerned with the details of how these services are implemented or where they are located.

```js
const { Pool } = require('pg'); 
const pool = new Pool({
	connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL, 
});
```
### 5. Build, Release, Run
Separate the build, release, and run stages. Use continuous integration to automate the build stage, package the app for release, and then deploy it to the desired environment.
```yaml
# Example CI pipeline configuration 
stages:
	- build  
	- test  
	- release  
	- deploy
```
### 6. Processes
Execute the app as one or more stateless processes. Each process runs independently and communicates with others through well-defined APIs.
```sh
# Running a Python Flask app as a process 
flask run --host=0.0.0.0
```
### 7. Port Binding
Expose services on well-known ports. The app should bind to a specific port and not rely on external proxies or load balancers for routing traffic.
```java
// Java Spring Boot example 

@ServerPort(8080) 
int getPort() {
	return port; 
}
```
### 8. Concurrency
Scale out via the process model. Add more instances of the app to handle increased load, leveraging the operating system's process management capabilities.
```sh
# Scaling out a Node.js app 

node app.js &
```
### 9. Disposability
Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown. Apps should start quickly and shut down cleanly, releasing all resources.
```sh
# Graceful shutdown script for a Node.js app 

pm2 stop app
```
### 10. Dev/Prod Parity
Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible. Use the same tech stack and configurations across environments to avoid surprises.
```sh
# Using Docker Compose for consistent environments 

docker-compose up
```
### 11. Logs
Treat logs as event streams. Aggregate logs from all instances of the app and direct them to a centralized logging system.
```js
// Logging in a Node.js app

console.log('Hello, World!');
```
### 12. Admin Processes
Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes. These tasks should be isolated from regular operations and executed manually or triggered by events.
```sh
# Running a one-off task in a Django app 

python manage.py migrate
```

By adhering to these twelve factors, developers can build scalable, maintainable, and reliable software-as-a-service applications.

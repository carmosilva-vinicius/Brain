Software architecture refers to the design decisions related to the overall structure and behavior of a software system. It encompasses the organization of a system, including all components, their interactions, the environment in which they operate, and the principles used for designing the software. This concept is crucial for understanding how a system will achieve essential qualities such as modifiability, availability, and security. Software architecture supports the analysis of system qualities before implementation, integration, or deployment, enabling teams to make informed decisions about the system's design. It serves as the conceptual framework that guides every phase of a project, facilitating agility, cost savings, and early identification of design risks. Effective software architecture, supported by agile architecture practices, enables continuous system evolution, predictability in product quality, and cost-effective system evolution.

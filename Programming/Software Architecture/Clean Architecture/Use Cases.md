In the context of [[Clean Architecture]], use cases are defined within the business rules layer (or use cases layer) of the architecture. This layer is responsible for containing the application's business logic, where specific functionalities of the system are implemented.

To effectively define use cases within Clean Architecture, you can follow these practices:

- **Identify System Requirements**: Before anything else, it's crucial to understand the system's requirements and user needs. This will help determine which use cases need to be implemented.
- **Define Use Cases**: Based on the identified requirements, you can define the application's use cases. Each use case should represent a functionality or a set of specific functionalities that the system offers to users.
- **Name Use Cases Clearly and Concisely**: The names of use cases should be descriptive and indicative of what the functionality does. This will facilitate understanding and communication among team members.
- **Identify Involved Actors**: For each use case, identify the actors (users, external systems, etc.) that interact with the system and their responsibilities within the functionality context.
- **Describe Event Flows**: For each use case, describe the event flows that represent the different interactions between actors and the system. This includes the necessary steps to complete the functionality, as well as possible exception scenarios.
- **Implement Use Cases in the Business Rules Layer**: After defining the use cases, you can implement them in the business rules layer of Clean Architecture. Each use case should be a class or a component that encapsulates the corresponding business logic.
- **Test Use Cases Isolated**: Ensure that each use case is tested in isolation to guarantee they work as expected. This can be done using unit tests and integration tests.

By following these practices, you will be able to define and implement use cases effectively within Clean Architecture, ensuring that your application's business logic is well organized and easy to maintain.

For our Festival example application, let's list some general ideas for use cases that are not directly related to users, focusing on the course:

1. **Purchase Ticket**
    - Description: Allows a user to purchase tickets for an event.
    - Main Flow:
        - The user selects the desired event.
        - The user chooses the quantity of tickets they want to buy.
        - The system checks ticket availability.
        - The user provides payment information.
        - The system processes the payment and confirms the purchase.
        - The system issues tickets to the user.

2. **View Event Details**
    - Description: Allows a user to see details of a specific event.
    - Main Flow:
        - The user selects the desired event.
        - The system displays information about the event, such as name, date, location, ticket prices, etc.

3. **Search Events by Category**
    - Description: Allows a user to search events by category.
    - Main Flow:
        - The user selects a category of events (e.g., music, sports, theater, etc.).
        - The system displays a list of events related to the selected category.

4. **Manage User Profile**
    - Description: Allows a user to manage their profile in the application.
    - Main Flow:
        - The user accesses the profile area.
        - The user views and edits personal information, such as name, address, password, etc.

5. **Cancel Ticket Purchase**
    - Description: Allows a user to cancel a ticket purchase before the event.
    - Main Flow:
        - The user accesses the list of purchases made.
        - The user selects the purchase they want to cancel.
        - The system checks if the event has not yet occurred.
        - The system cancels the purchase and issues a refund, if applicable.

These are just some examples of use cases for a ticket sales application for various events. Each use case represents a specific functionality that users can perform in the application. You can expand or adapt these use cases according to the specific requirements of your system.

Objects of value (value objects) represent values that are important for the application's domain but do not have their own identity. They are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed once created. Value objects are typically used to model domain concepts defined exclusively by their attributes, without a distinct identity.

For example, a common value object could be "Address," including attributes such as street, city, state, ZIP code, etc. Each instance of "Address" is distinct only by its attributes and can be compared with other instances based on these values.

The distinction between entities and value objects is important in Clean Architecture because it helps define clear boundaries between domain concepts and implementation details. Entities encapsulate the core business logic of the application and represent concepts with their own identity and long lifecycle. On the other hand, value objects represent values important to the domain but do not have their own identity and are primarily used to define immutable types and semantics.

When designing systems using Clean Architecture, it's important to identify and model entities and value objects appropriately for the application's domain, ensuring that the code is cohesive, understandable, and easy to maintain.

In a system adhering to the principles of [[Clean Architecture]], "gateways" are found within both the application package (application) and the infrastructure package (infra). Although both types of gateways serve to manage external interactions beyond the core application, they have slightly different purposes and responsibilities.

- **Gateways in the Application Package**: These gateways are responsible for defining abstract interfaces or contracts for the necessary external interactions required for use cases to execute. They represent how use cases interact with the external world and are defined in terms of high-level operations that the system needs to perform. For instance, an application gateway might define an `IUserRepository` interface with methods like `ListAll`, `AddUser`, `DeleteUser`, etc. This interface represents how use cases interact with data storage but does not specify the concrete implementation of these operations.

- **Gateways in the Infrastructure Package**: These gateways are tasked with implementing the contracts defined by the application gateways. They provide concrete implementations for the operations defined in gateway interfaces, utilizing specific infrastructure technologies such as database access, network communication, etc. Continuing the previous example, in the infrastructure package, there could be a concrete implementation of `IUserRepository` using JDBC, JPA, Hibernate, or any other persistence framework. This specific implementation is responsible for translating the high-level operations defined in the gateway interface into actual database calls, such as with the `UserRepositoryJpa` class.

In summary, application gateways define abstract contracts for external interactions, while infrastructure gateways provide concrete implementations of these contracts using specific infrastructure technologies. This separation of responsibilities and levels of abstraction allows the application's business logic to remain independent of implementation details, facilitating the future replacement or modification of infrastructure technologies.

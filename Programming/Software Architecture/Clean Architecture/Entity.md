Is a domain object that encapsulates business logic and represents the core concepts of the problem domain. Entities are not dependent on any specific implementation detail or framework and are typically defined as pure data structures. They are independent of the application's use cases, meaning they focus on the business rules and data without being tied to the application's specific functionalities or interfaces.

Entities should indeed have a way to ensure each instance is unique, typically through a key property. This uniqueness is crucial for identifying and managing instances of entities, especially when dealing with persistence and relationships between entities. The key property often serves as the primary identifier for the entity, allowing for efficient retrieval, update, and deletion operations in the database.

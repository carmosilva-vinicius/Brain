In [[DDD]], domain Events are significant occurrences representing changes in the domain's state. They describe occurrences within the problem domain of interest to other parts of the system, facilitating communication and coordination among components.
#### Examples:
Events such as a confirmed order, product added to the shopping cart, or user registration signify significant changes in the system's state.
```python
from datetime import datetime

class OrderConfirmedEvent:
    def __init__(self, order_id, timestamp=datetime.now()):
        self.order_id = order_id
        self.timestamp = timestamp
```
This `OrderConfirmedEvent` class represents an event triggered when an order is confirmed. It carries essential information about the event, such as the order ID and the timestamp, allowing other parts of the system to react appropriately.

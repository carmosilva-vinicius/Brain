Domain Services in Domain-Driven Design ([[DDD]]) are specialized objects designed to encapsulate business logic that does not naturally belong to a single entity or value object. These services represent operations or processes involving multiple entities or those lacking a clear responsibility assigned to a single entity.

Example:
Consider a scenario where a domain service calculates the total price of a purchase, validates an order, or generates statistics based on various system entities. These services perform isolated tasks, focusing on executing specific functions without maintaining state.

```python
class PurchaseTotalCalculator:
    def __init__(self, cart):
        self.cart = cart
	
    def calculate_total(self):
        return sum(item.price * item.quantity for item in self.cart.items())
```
This example demonstrates a domain service `PurchaseTotalCalculator` responsible for calculating the total cost of items in a shopping cart. It encapsulates the logic needed for this calculation, keeping the entity (cart) clean and focused on its primary responsibilities.

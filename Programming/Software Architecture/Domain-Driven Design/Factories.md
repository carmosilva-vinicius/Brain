**Factories** in [[DDD]] are specialized objects responsible for creating complex Entities or Aggregates. They encapsulate the logic required to instantiate these complex objects, often involving the creation of multiple related objects or the configuration of complex initial states. Factories can simplify the creation process, especially when dealing with intricate dependencies or configurations. For instance, a `ProductFactory` in an e-commerce platform might handle the creation of a `Product` entity, including setting up its `Price`, `Stock`, and `Category` attributes according to predefined business rules.

```java
public class CarFactory {
    public Car createCar(String licensePlate, String colorName) {
        return new Car(licensePlate, new Color(colorName));
    }
}
```

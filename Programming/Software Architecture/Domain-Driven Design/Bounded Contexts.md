In Domain-Driven Design ([[DDD]]), Bounded Contexts (BCs) are crucial for managing complexity in large and intricate software projects. BCs serve as clear boundaries within a system, allowing for consistent application of domain models. They address the challenge of modeling multiple interrelated domains or subdomains in complex systems, preventing inconsistencies in business representation. By enabling separate modeling, business rules, and ubiquitous languages for each domain, BCs facilitate the development of smaller, more manageable parts of the system, each with its independent domain model. This approach enhances system flexibility and scalability, as different parts can evolve independently, simplifying maintenance and expansion. Effective use of BCs involves clear definition of context boundaries, often aided by Context Mapping techniques, and establishing communication mechanisms between contexts to manage interactions and translations. Without BCs, software can become a tangled web of interconnected and dependent components, complicating understanding, maintenance, and evolution. Thus, defining clear BCs separates the system into smaller, more manageable pieces, each addressing a specific problem domain, significantly aiding in software development, maintenance, and evolution.

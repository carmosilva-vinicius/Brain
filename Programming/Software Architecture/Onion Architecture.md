Is [[Software Architecture]] pattern designed to promote a modular and loosely coupled design, emphasizing separation of concerns and maintainability. It aims to create applications that are more flexible, testable, and easier to evolve over time. The architecture is structured around concentric layers, with the innermost layer containing the core business logic and entities, and the outer layers handling external concerns such as user interfaces, databases, and external services.

Key concepts of the Onion Architecture include:

- **Domain Layer**: Contains the core business logic, entities, and business rules of the application.
- **Application Layer**: Implements use cases and coordinates the flow of data between the domain and infrastructure layers.
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Manages external concerns like databases, file systems, or external services.
- **Presentation Layer**: Deals with user interfaces and presentation-related logic.

The architecture emphasizes the flow of dependencies, with each layer depending on the layers directly below it. This setup ensures that the inner layers remain agnostic to the specifics of the outer layers, allowing for greater flexibility and maintainability. The outer layers implement interfaces defined by the inner layers, enabling the encapsulation of business logic without concerning itself with implementation details.

One of the significant advantages of the Onion Architecture is its support for high testability, as everything depends on abstractions that can be easily mocked. This approach also facilitates the separation of concerns, making the codebase easier to navigate and modify. Additionally, it supports the principle of dependency inversion, allowing for the swapping of implementations at runtime transparently.

In practice, the Onion Architecture can be implemented in various frameworks, including ASP.NET Core, by organizing the codebase into distinct projects for each layer. This structure not only adheres to the architecture's principles but also enhances the application's modularity and maintainability.

Structural design patterns provide solutions for organizing classes and objects to build larger, cohesive, and efficient structures in software design. These patterns streamline relationships between components, enabling developers to create scalable, maintainable, and flexible architectures. By focusing on inheritance and object composition, structural patterns promote code reuse, simplify complex hierarchies, and enhance overall system design.

A Check constraint in [[SQL Server]] is a rule applied to a column or a group of columns within a table to limit the values that can be stored in those columns. It ensures that all data in a column meets certain criteria before it is inserted or updated in the table. Check constraints are used to maintain the integrity of the data by enforcing business rules and preventing invalid data from being saved in the database.

### Key Points About Check Constraints:

- **Purpose**: They are designed to enforce domain integrity by restricting the values that can be placed in a column or across multiple columns. This helps in validating the data according to predefined rules before it is stored in the database [2](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_check.asp)[3](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/tables/create-check-constraints?view=sql-server-ver16)[4](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/tables/unique-constraints-and-check-constraints?view=sql-server-ver16).
- **Implementation**: Check constraints can be defined at the column level, allowing only certain values for that column, or at the table level, where they can limit the values in certain columns based on values in other columns within the same row [2](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_check.asp)[3](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/tables/create-check-constraints?view=sql-server-ver16).
- **Syntax**: The basic syntax for defining a check constraint involves specifying the `CHECK` keyword followed by a Boolean expression that evaluates to either TRUE or FALSE. For example, to ensure that a `salary` column contains values between $15,000 and $100,000, the constraint would be defined as `CHECK (salary >= 15000 AND salary <= 100000)` [4](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/tables/unique-constraints-and-check-constraints?view=sql-server-ver16).
- **Limitations**: There are several limitations to check constraints, including:
    - They operate at the row level and are typically enforced when a row is directly updated or inserted. This means they might not catch violations that occur indirectly through other transactions [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Check_constraint).
    - Null values are treated differently; since they evaluate to UNKNOWN, a check constraint might not behave as expected if it includes null values in its evaluation [4](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/tables/unique-constraints-and-check-constraints?view=sql-server-ver16).
    - Check constraints are not validated during DELETE operations, which can lead to unexpected behavior if not carefully managed [4](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/tables/unique-constraints-and-check-constraints?view=sql-server-ver16).
- **Performance Consideration**: While check constraints help maintain data integrity, they can impact performance, especially if they involve complex calculations or functions. SQL Server optimizes the enforcement of check constraints to minimize performance overhead, but it's essential to design constraints efficiently to avoid unnecessary performance hits [5](https://www.sqlshack.com/how-to-use-sql-check-constraints/).
- **Usage Examples**: Check constraints can be used in various scenarios, such as ensuring that a column contains only positive numbers, confirming that a combination of values in different columns adheres to a specific rule, or verifying that a date falls within a particular range [5](https://www.sqlshack.com/how-to-use-sql-check-constraints/).

In summary, check constraints are a powerful tool for enforcing data integrity in SQL Server databases. By carefully designing and implementing these constraints, developers can ensure that their databases store accurate and consistent data, reducing the risk of errors and inconsistencies.

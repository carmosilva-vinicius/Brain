Bulk insert technique is a method used in [[Database|databases]] to insert large amounts of data into a database table in a single transaction, as opposed to inserting each row individually. This technique is commonly used in scenarios where a massive amount of data needs to be inserted into a database as it significantly improves performance by reducing the amount of individual insert statements and database roundtrips[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/758945/whats-the-fastest-way-to-do-a-bulk-insert-into-postgres).

This knowledge belongs to the area of database management, specifically under the practices of efficient data manipulation and [[Performance and Optimization]] techniques.

In PostgreSQL, there are two main ways to perform bulk inserts:

1. Using the `COPY` command: The `COPY` command is a PostgreSQL specific feature which allows efficient bulk inserts. It takes a CSV file as input and inserts the data into the specified table[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/758945/whats-the-fastest-way-to-do-a-bulk-insert-into-postgres).
2. Using the multirow `VALUES` syntax: This method allows you to insert multiple rows in a single SQL query. It's a standard SQL feature and it's supported by many other SQL databases[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/758945/whats-the-fastest-way-to-do-a-bulk-insert-into-postgres).

In the context of ASP.NET, you can use the Npgsql library, which is a .NET data provider for PostgreSQL. It supports the `COPY` command through the `BeginBinaryImport` method. Here's an example of how you can use it to perform a bulk insert in PostgreSQL:
```cs
using (var writer = conn.BeginBinaryImport(
    "copy user_data.part_list from STDIN (FORMAT BINARY)"))
{
    foreach (var record in RecordList)
    {
        writer.StartRow();
        writer.Write(record.UserId);
        writer.Write(record.Age, NpgsqlTypes.NpgsqlDbType.Integer);
        writer.Write(record.HireDate, NpgsqlTypes.NpgsqlDbType.Date);
    }
    writer.Complete();
}
```

Lastly, it's worth noting that while these methods can significantly improve performance for large data loads, they should be used with care. For instance, the `COPY` command requires superuser rights by default, though it can be granted to non-superusers as well. Also, these methods bypass some of the checks and constraints that are performed when inserting data row by row, so you should ensure your data is clean and valid before performing a bulk insert[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/758945/whats-the-fastest-way-to-do-a-bulk-insert-into-postgres).

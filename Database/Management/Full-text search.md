Full-text search is a technique used in database searching and information retrieval that can find a specific sequence of characters or words in a collection of documents or fields. It is commonly used in search engines to enhance the search experience. The primary advantage of full-text search over other search methods is its ability to search for words or phrases in the text rather than just matching exact characters. It can also handle operations like prefix matching and relevance ranking [3](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1489617/how-do-you-do-phrase-based-full-text-search-in-postgres-that-takes-advantage-of).

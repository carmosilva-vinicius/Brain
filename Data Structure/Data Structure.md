Refer to the organization, management, and storage of data in a way that allows for efficient access, modification, and retrieval. They provide a framework for organizing and manipulating data to facilitate various operations and algorithms.

Data structures define how data is stored in computer memory and how it can be accessed and manipulated. They are designed to optimize the efficiency of data handling, taking into consideration factors such as time complexity (how long an operation takes) and space complexity (how much memory is required).

## Linear
Data structure in which data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly, where each element is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements, is called a linear data structure. _Examples of linear data structures are [[Array]], [[Stack]], [[Queue]], [[Linked List]], etc._ ^a4aea2
    - **Static data structure:** Static data structure has a fixed memory size. It is easier to access the elements in a static data structure. _An example of this data structure is an array._
    - **Dynamic data structure:** In dynamic data structure, the size is not fixed. It can be randomly updated during the runtime which may be considered efficient concerning the memory (space) complexity of the code. _Examples of this data structure are queue, stack, etc._
## Non-Linear
Data structures where data elements are not placed sequentially or linearly are called non-linear data structures. In a non-linear data structure, we can’t traverse all the elements in a single run only. _Examples of non-linear data structures are [[Tree]] and graphs.

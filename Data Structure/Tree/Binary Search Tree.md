Is a special type of [[Binary Tree]], where it organize the node in way, depending on its data value. In BSTs the value of left child node should be smaller than the parent node value. On the other hand, the right ones should be greater than the parent node. This rule should be applied recursively, from the root until the leaves.

**Binary Search Tree** rules:
- The left sub-tree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.
- The right sub-tree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
- The left and right sub-tree each must also be a binary search tree.

Is a [[Data Structure#Non-Linear|non-linear data structure]] which the elements are stored and organized in a hierarchical way. Each element are called as *node*, where each one can have a parent or/and children nodes. Easy way to navigate or search and only one path between any two node of the tree, are important characteristics of tree data structure.

The first node of tree (the ones that doesn't have any parent) is called the *root*. Including the root each node can have multiple child nodes, and these child nodes can also have their own child nodes recursively.

In the world of [[Web]] systems, "cache" refers to a temporary storage location that holds copies of frequently accessed data. This stored data can be retrieved much faster than fetching it from its original source, leading to **improved performance and reduced load on servers**.

There are two main types of web caches:

**1. Browser Cache:** This is built into your web browser and stores copies of recently visited websites or their components (like images, CSS, and JavaScript files). When you revisit a site, the browser can often display these elements from the cache without needing to download them again, making the page load much faster.

**2. Server-Side Cache:** This sits between the web server and the internet, acting as a middleman. When a user requests a webpage, the cache checks if it has a copy stored. If it does, it delivers the copy directly to the user, saving the server from having to process the request and reducing its workload. There are two main types of server-side caches:

- **Reverse Proxy Cache:** This sits in front of the web server and caches static content like images, videos, and other files.
- **Application Cache:** This stores dynamic content generated by the web application, but only when explicitly instructed by the developer.

Here are some of the **benefits of using web caching:**

- **Faster loading times:** By serving content from the cache, websites can load much quicker, especially for repeat visitors.
- **Reduced server load:** Caches take the pressure off web servers by handling frequent requests for static content, allowing them to focus on more complex tasks.
- **Improved scalability:** With less load on individual servers, websites can handle more traffic without performance issues.
- **Lower bandwidth usage:** Cached data doesn't need to be transmitted over the internet again, saving bandwidth for both users and providers.

However, it's important to note that caching isn't always ideal. For example, frequently changing content should not be cached, as users might see outdated information. Additionally, cache invalidation strategies need to be implemented to ensure that cached data remains relevant when the original source is updated.

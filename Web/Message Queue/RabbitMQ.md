RabbitMQ is an open-source [[Message Queue|message broker]] that implements the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP). It's a software where queues are defined, and applications connect to these queues to transfer messages. These messages can include any kind of information, from simple text messages to instructions about a process or task that should start on another application. The RabbitMQ software stores the messages until a receiving application connects and takes a message off the queue to process it [1](https://www.cloudamqp.com/blog/part1-rabbitmq-for-beginners-what-is-rabbitmq.html).

RabbitMQ is used to decouple software components, providing a common platform for applications to send and receive messages. It provides a safe place for your messages until they are received [3](https://www.rabbitmq.com/features.html). It is built on the Open Telecom Platform framework for clustering and failover, and offers client libraries to interface with the broker for all major programming languages [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RabbitMQ).

RabbitMQ works by routing messages from a producer to a consumer. The producer publishes a message to an exchange, which then routes the message to the appropriate queues. Consumers subscribe to these queues to receive the messages. This architecture allows for low coupling between the sender and receiver, as they only communicate through the messages they send to each other [1](https://www.cloudamqp.com/blog/part1-rabbitmq-for-beginners-what-is-rabbitmq.html).

RabbitMQ features include reliability, flexible routing, clustering, federation, high availability of queues, multi-protocol support, a management UI, and a plugin system. It also supports multiple messaging protocols, and there are RabbitMQ clients for almost any language [3](https://www.rabbitmq.com/features.html).

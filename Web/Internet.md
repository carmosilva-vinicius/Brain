Is a global network initially thought for computers but use by a lot of other devices nowadays. In thesis, each device connected to this network must have a unique address. These addresses are in the form **nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn** where nnn must be a number from 0 - 255. This address is known as an IP address. (IP stands for Internet Protocol; more on this later.)

Once there are not enough IPV4 for every device in the world, the internet service provider (isp) uses a kind of subnet, where it  provice IP for this internal net but the ISP has the real connection with the internet WAN.

Internet is where [[Web]] application can be accessed and shared between users in different parts of the world

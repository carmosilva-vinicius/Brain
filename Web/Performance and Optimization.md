# Lazy Loading

A technique used in web development to defer the loading or initialization of resources or objects until they are actually needed. It is commonly used to improve performance, save system resources, and enhance the user experience.

Applied to resources like images, videos, or scripts that are not immediately visible or required when a web page is loaded. Instead of loading these resources upfront, they are loaded dynamically when the user interacts with the page, such as scrolling down to view an image or clicking on a button to load additional content.
